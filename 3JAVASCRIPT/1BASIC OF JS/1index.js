var message;

// also we can use it more than 1 times
console.log(message);

console.log(message);

// we can update it by doing this
message = "My name is Abhishek";
console.log(message);

// or we can assign a variable by using let

let text;

text = "I'm trying to learn js";

console.log(text)

// now we will discuss on some points 
// there are some pre-reserved keys 
// lets discuss on one


// let name = "Abhishek shrivastava"
// now see what it will look like

// console.log(name) // as u can see that it will print but it is not a valid way to do it

// const number; // const should be initialized it does not work same as var and let

const number = 3; // its constant it can not be change

//like if we do this
// number = 5 // it wont work
console.log(number)
